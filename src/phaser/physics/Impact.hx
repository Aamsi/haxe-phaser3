/**
 * An Impact.js compatible physics world, body and solver, for those who are used
 * to the Impact way of defining and controlling physics bodies. Also works with
 * the new Loader support for Weltmeister map data.
 *
 * World updated to run off the Phaser main loop.
 * Body extended to support additional setter functions.
 *
 * To create the map data you'll need Weltmeister, which comes with Impact
 * and can be purchased from http://impactjs.com
 *
 * My thanks to Dominic Szablewski for his permission to support Impact in Phaser.
