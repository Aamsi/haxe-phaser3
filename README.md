# Haxe Phaser 3 bindings

This contains bindings for Phaser 3 (3.9).

!!! BE CAREFULL, those bindings are not perfect !!!

It's highly recommanded to understand how bindings works to use that. If you have a compilation error (function call mismatch for example), check if it's not a bad definition in the bindings.

Those bindings have been used for a LudumDare game and it was usable. Some manual editing have been made (It's now integrated to the script that generates the bindings).

The bindings have been generated with this script : https://github.com/sebbernery/haxe-phaser3-generator .
